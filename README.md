# Bevy Game of Life
This is a small implementation of Convay's Game of Life using the Bevy engine. I made this project
to learn the bevy engine and ECS.

## Controls
The game starts paused. You can draw cells using the mouse while holding down the left mouse button.
Pause/Resume the game using space. Increase/Decrease the simulation speed using the left and right
arrow keys. You can clear the grid using C.
